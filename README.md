# search
A search program for Unix

This search program allows the user to type in an (optional) directory and search term and use grep to locate each occurence of the term in that directory, as well as listing the file that term is found in.
The program will eventually allow users to type in additional terms to search for or to exclude results.
Tests are yet to be written.
